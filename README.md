# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn. The analysis helps businesses take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical customer data
- Identify key factors influencing churn
- Build and evaluate churn prediction models
- Provide data-driven recommendations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (data processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Process

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data quality. This is followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Based on these insights, relevant features are engineered to enhance model performance. Several machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, are then trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. Finally, the results are interpreted to identify key drivers of churn, and actionable insights are derived to support business decisions aimed at reducing customer attrition.

## Results

- Developed classification models to predict churn
- Identified critical churn indicators
- Suggested actionable strategies for retention
